# Project Description
- What is the purpose of your research project?  

According to Feeding America in 2017, 1 in 8 Americans are food insecure, which equates to 40 million people. Being food insecure is defined as "lacking reliable access to a sufficient quantity of affordable, nutritious food". The purpose of this project is to analyze food insecurity in the United States and interpret patterns we may find in the data. We hope to make impactful vizualizations that will bring light to the public health issue of food insecurity in the US and in specific states.

- What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.  

We will be working with a data set from United States Department of Agriculture that looks at food insecurity and other categories.
Access and Proximity to Grocery Store
Store Availability
Restaurant Availability and Expenditures
Food Assistance
State Food Insecurity
Food Prices and Taxes
Local Foods
Health and Physical Activity
Socioeconomic Characteristics
There is data on all of these charactristics for every county in each state.

- Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.  

Policy makers in America, major donors/philathropists, charities.

- What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)

The audience needs to become familiarized with the severity of food insecurity in certain regions of the United States. We will show how specific factors impact the food insecurity of local populations (data by county), and where American citizens face obstacles in mobility and access of healthy foods and resources.

> Purpose: Analyze food insecurity in the United States.
> Research that has been done:  
> What's the dataset:  https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/documentation/  
> Target audience: Policy-makers  
> What do we want them to learn: The severity of food insecurity, factors that effect food insecurity, where resources should be allocated  
> Three questions:

# Technical Description
Our final product will be a compiled RMarkdown page that will be hosted
- What will be the format of your final product (Shiny app, HTML page, compiled .Rmd file, etc)?  
- Do you anticipate any specific data collection / data management challenges?  
- What new technical skills will need to learn in order to complete your project?  
- What major challenges do you anticipate?


# Project Set-Up
- Create a public repository on GitHub in which you'll be completing your final projects.  All group members should be added to the repo so they can push directly to it  
- Create at least 5 GitHub Issues as your first set of steps to take in the project.  You should assign these to individual group members to complete
