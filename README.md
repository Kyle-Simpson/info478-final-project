# Project Description
- What is the purpose of your research project?  
- What other research has been done in this area? Make sure to include 3+ links to related works.  
- What is the dataset you'll be working with?  Please include background on who collected the data, where you accessed it, and any additional information we should know about how this data came to be.  
- Who is your target audience?  Depending on the domain of your data, there may be a variety of audiences interested in using the dataset. You should hone in on one of these audiences.  
- What should your audience learn from your resource? Please consider specific questions that your project can answer using the data you have identified (that are related to the overarching purpose)

> Purpose: Analyze food insecurity in the United States.  
> Research that has been done:  
> What's the dataset:  https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/food-environment-atlas/documentation/  
> Target audience: Policy-makers  
> What do we want them to learn: The severity of food insecurity, factors that effect food insecurity, where resources should be allocated  
> Three questions:
> - Is adult obesity rate linked to socioeconomic status?  
> - Does food insecurity vary by age?
> - In Washington, what counties have the least amount of access to healthy food?

# Technical Description
Our final product will be a compiled RMarkdown page that will be hosted on one of our GitHub profiles.  We like the simplicity and efficiency of creating an RMarkdown resource and can still inject interactivity for specific plots of interest.  
We anticipate that our primary data management challenges will be sifting through the depth of our dataset.  Since there are 13 categories of data across each county in the United States, our primary challenge will be creating efficient representations of our data once our analysis is complete.  
In terms of new technical skills we will learn, none of us have worked on injecting interactivity into RMarkdown without using Shiny, so we anticipate there will be a slight learning curve as we approach the conclusion of our project.
